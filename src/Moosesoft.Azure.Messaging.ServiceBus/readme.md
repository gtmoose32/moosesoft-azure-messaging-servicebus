# Moosesoft.Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus

## What is it?

A library for .NET that uses policies to handle transient exceptions while processing messages from [Azure Service Bus](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus_7.12.0/sdk/servicebus/Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus/README.md).  Failure policies can apply delays to further message processing based on delay calculation strategies.
